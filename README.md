2. User hits an operation (for instance + ). User can enter another number now. The textview still shows the old
number until the user starts entering another number.
3. User enters another number (which is displayed on top textview)
4. a. If the user presses =, the result is displayed and the user can press another operation
b. If the user presses an operation (for instance, -), the result of the previous operation is displayed on the
textview until the user starts entering another number.
C button clears everything.
+/- makes a number positive or negative.
